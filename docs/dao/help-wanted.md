<br />

There's lots of ways to get involved in the Cryptoeconomics.Study community. The most import Issues are curated in our [DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xEAA147020b006e6Bfe9e3e1A9f1FaD330A9E20F5/). We do this by staking Carrots to open GitHub Issues in the [Projects app](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xEAA147020b006e6Bfe9e3e1A9f1FaD330A9E20F5/0x32016d05910e344470ec832ed344a385ab18ae6b). If you'd like to contribute please visit the DAO and signal your interest to help out :)

<br />

We also have a lot of archived projects that could use some support. The contributing guide on the forum lists these, and if you want to contribute or thing we should create Carrot bounties for these please let us know!
